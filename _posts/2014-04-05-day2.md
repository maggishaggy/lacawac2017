## Overview

This session will introduce you to the following:

+ Understanding your computer's organization
+ Using the command line
+ Regular expressions
+ Installing standard software packages 

For a more in-depth look at these concepts (and more!), I **highly recommend** the **really excellent** book [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org) by Haddock and Dunn. This book is a thorough, entry-level overview of introductory computing concepts, showcased with hands-on exercises. The book's accompanying website (linked above) is also regularly updated with important tips, examples, and errata. Many of today's materials were borrowed from this book, as well.

## Materials

You can download slides for today's session [here](../day2/commandline.pptx). You may (will!) find it helpful to download a Text Editor that can handle regular expressions. 

+ **Mac Users**: Download [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
+ **Linux/VM/Windows Users**: Download [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)



## Command Line exercises









## Regular expression exercises

Use regular expressions to change each string and/or file contents to the desired target. Feel free to perform these operations using your regex-enabled text editor.

To check that you have succeeded in changing file contents, use the `diff` command. This UNIX command shows **diff**erences between two text files. If there is no output from the `diff` command, then the two files are identical. Use `diff` as follows:

```{bash}
diff a.txt b.txt
```
> Protip: Note all whitespace is created equal! Just because two files look the same to you doesn't mean they are the same.

1. Use regular expressions to change the contents of the FASTA sequence file [exampleGFP_raw.fasta](../day2/exampleGFP_raw.fasta) to match the contents of the file [exampleGFP_clean.fasta](../day2/exampleGFP_clean.fasta).


2. Use regular expressions to change the file contents of the file [data1_raw.txt](../day2/data1_raw.txt) to match the contents of the file [data1_clean.txt](../day2/data1_clean.txt).

	+ Once you have succeeded, try to perform all replacements using a **single** regular expression.

3. Generate a single masterful regular expression that can match a phone number in *any of the following formats below* and convert it to a phone number into this format: `(XXX)-XXX-XXXX`.
