## Overview

This session will introduce you to the following:

+ Understanding your computer's organization
+ Using the command line
+ Regular expressions
+ (Time permitting) introduction to concepts in programming

For a more in-depth look at these concepts (and more!), I **highly recommend** the **really excellent** book [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org) by Haddock and Dunn. This book is a thorough, entry-level overview of introductory computing concepts, showcased with hands-on exercises. The book's accompanying website (linked above) is also regularly updated with important tips, examples, and errata. Many of today's materials were borrowed from this book, as well.
