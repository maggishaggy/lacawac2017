## Overview

This session will introduce you to the following:

+ Understanding your computer's organization
+ Using the command line
+ Regular expressions
+ Installing standard software packages 

For a more in-depth look at these concepts (and more!), I **highly recommend** the **really excellent** book [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org) by Haddock and Dunn. This book is a thorough, entry-level overview of introductory computing concepts, showcased with hands-on exercises. The book's accompanying website (linked above) is also regularly updated with important tips, examples, and errata.

## Materials

You can download slides for today's session [here](../day2/commandline.pptx). You may (will!) find it helpful to download a Text Editor that can handle regular expressions. 

+ **Mac Users**: Download [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
+ **Linux/VM/Windows Users**: Download [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)



## Command Line exercises

+ Launch a terminal session and enter the command `pwd` to determine which directory you are in. If you are not in your home directory, then navigate there by simply typing `cd` (without an argument this takes you home!)

+ Create a new directory called `lacawac` using the command `mkdir`. Navigate into this directory with `cd` and enter `pwd` to confirm your successful directory change.

+ List the contents of this directory using the command `ls -la`, which includes two flags: `-l` to list in long format and `-a` to list to show hidden files. What are the contents of this new directory (even though it "should" be empty)? 

+ Create a file called `myfile.txt` using this command: ``` echo "This is my new file." > myfile.txt```
   
+ Use `less` to examine the contents of `myfile.txt`. Is is what you expected?

+ Now issue this command: ```echo "oh man more words" > myfile.txt``` and again examine the contents. What changed, and why?

+ Finally, issue this command: ```echo "the last words" >> myfile.txt```. Yet again rexamine the file contents. Think about how and why the contents are what they are. 

+ Now create another directory, inside `lacawac/`, called `lodge`. **Copy** the file `myfile.txt` into `lodge` using `cp`. The new file should be called `mynewfile.txt`. 

+ In theory, the contents of `myfile.txt` and `mynewfile.txt` should be identical at this point. Confirm this using the command `diff`, which determines the difference between two text files:  ```diff myfile.txt lodge/mynewfile.txt```. If there is no difference between files, then `diff` will not yield any output.

+ Now create some differences between the files. Issue the command (note, you're still in the directory `lacawac`!) ```echo "different now" >> lodge/mynewfile.txt```. Re-run the `diff` command from step #10 and see how the output has changed.

+ At long last, navigate into the `lodge/` directory with `cd`. Rename the file `mynewfile.txt` to `myfavefile.txt` using the `mv` command. Use `ls` afterwards to confirm that your command worked.

+ Now remove the file `myfavefile.txt` using `rm`. 

+ Navigate one directory up, back into `lacawac/`, with the command `cd ..`. Enter `pwd` to confirm that this worked. Now remove *the directory* `lodge/` using `rm` (Hint: which flag do you need to use?). Use `ls` again to confirm that the directory is gone.

+ Navigate to your home directory (which is one directory up from `lacawac/`). Use any of these commands:

		 cd
		 cd ~
		 cd ..
		 
Confirm using `pwd`.

+ Create a new empty file called `.secretfile` using the `touch` command. Enter `ls` to confirm that the file was created (Hint: does `ls` work for this goal? how can we make `ls` work for this goal?).

## Regular expression exercises

Use regular expressions to change each string and/or file contents to the desired target. Feel free to perform these operations using your regex-enabled text editor.

To check that you have succeeded in changing file contents, use the `diff` command. This UNIX command shows **diff**erences between two text files. If there is no output from the `diff` command, then the two files are identical. Use `diff` as follows:

```{bash}
diff a.txt b.txt
```
> Protip: Note all whitespace is created equal! Just because two files look the same to you doesn't mean they are the same.

1. Use regular expressions to change the contents of the FASTA sequence file [exampleGFP_raw.fasta](../day2/exampleGFP_raw.fasta) to match the contents of the file [exampleGFP_clean.fasta](../day2/exampleGFP_clean.fasta).


2. Use regular expressions to change the file contents of the file [data1_raw.txt](../day2/data1_raw.txt) to match the contents of the file [data1_clean.txt](../day2/data1_clean.txt).

	+ Once you have succeeded, try to perform all replacements using a **single** regular expression.

3. Generate a single masterful regular expression that can match a phone number in *any of the following formats below* and convert it to a phone number into this format: `(XXX)-XXX-XXXX`.
