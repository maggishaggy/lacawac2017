# UNIX Cheatsheet

### Directory
  - A *folder* on your computer which contains files. UNIX filesystems are organized as hierarchical directories. 
  - Forward slashes divide levels in the nested hierarchy of directories, e.g. `/top_level_directory/second_level_directory`
  - The directory at the top of this hierarchy is called the **root** directory and is denoted simply as `/`. 

### Path
  - The *address* to a directory or file on your computer. There are, generally, two types of paths:
    - **Absolute/full path** represents the path of a given directory/file beginning at the root directory.
    - **Relative path** represents the path of a given directory/file relative to the working/current directory.

  - For example, say you have a file "my\_favorite\_file.txt" located in the directory `/Users/myname/Desktop/my_directory`.
    - The **full path** to this file  is `/Users/myname/Desktop/my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`.  
    - The **relative path** to this file depends on where you are on the computer. 
     - If you are calling this file from Desktop, the relative path would be `my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`
     - If you are in `/Users/myname/`, the relative path becomes `Desktop/my_directory/my_favorite_file.txt`.
    
   Remember - Whenever you call the full path, you can reach the file from anywhere on your computer. Relative paths will change based on your current location.
